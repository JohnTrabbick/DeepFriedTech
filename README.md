0.1

I believe that open source contributors should be paid the same way that the guys who work at the proprietary trash tech do.  Overall, a salary is probably the 2nd biggest incentive to work for something with the passion and motivation to do it being 1st.

Thus, I have given the option for volunteers to get some payment if they want to. However, since open source contributions vary much more than proprietary contributions, I will give some info on how I plan for these payments to work.

For one-time volunteers, feel free to nab my attention by making a post in the issues section with the "one-time commit request" tag.

You can also get paid as well, just get the "me want pay" tag and we will note that. You can get paid by doing stuff like correcting grammar or programming articles and stuff. I may put a higher payment/salary for certain things that are higher priority, you can find them in the wiki section.

For people who intend to stay with me to commit to the project for longer, you can also get commit commit permissions by going to the issues page and selecting the "long-term volunteer" tag. If you want to get paid, select the "me want pay" tag, and you can get paid the same way that the one-commit dudes do, with the exception that you will be paid out every month, with your actions stacking up until the paydate.

Note that I only accept crypto payments since I kinda don't have access to banking/paypal.
