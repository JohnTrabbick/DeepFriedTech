<h1>Brave Browser is a browser orientated around pirvacy and security of it's users. To achieve this, Brave Browser implements a variety of features such as Brave's "Browser Shield" to block trackers and ads from coming into play. You are also able to earn "money", which you can tip to your favorite content creators. But is it a little too much for a browser? In this blog post, I will see the pros and cons of using Brave.</h1>

<p style="background-color:green;color:white;padding5px;font-size:20px">The first pro of Brave is that it is strongly orientated and built around user privacy and anonymity. Using Brave, you get a full browser thats packed with features that safeguard your data, such as a advanced ad and tracker blocker, HTTPS enforcement, and NO built-in tracking. Virtually no data is collected at all using Brave.</p>

<p style="background-color:tomato;color:white;padding5px;font-size:20px;">The first con of using Brave is that it has average speeds. Even though its based on the speedy Chromium open-source browser, the speeds are not really impressive. Even with an adblocker which packs a punch against ad-riddled websites, the speed of Brave overall is so-so.</p>

<p style="background-color:green;color:white;padding5px;font-size:20px;">The second pro of Brave is that it is open source. Versus proprietary software, open source software receives much more security updates and features in comparison with proprietary software. As Brave is open source software, you can also contribute to Brave's source code and enjoy the benefits of volunteer contributions worldwide.</p>

<p style="background-color:green;color:white;padding5px;font-size:20px;">Brave Browser has a pretty great future ahead. The team behind Brave has plenty of plans to improve Brave, such as it's own ad network.</p>

<p style="background-color:gold;color:white;padding5px;font-size:20px;">Using Brave, you can earn free "money" by viewing ads via notifications or via skin/background. When you click or at least "view" the ad, you earn their browser token, the BAT, or Basic Attention Token, which you can use to tip websites. Some services allow you to transfer BAT to your own wallet as well. Though, be aware that some ads can be scams, and as most of it's advertising is based on crypto, you should really be careful on what ads you click on, especially if you use cryptocurrency.</p>

<strong><i>SUMMARY:</i></strong>

<p>Brave Browser is a browser focused on privacy and anonymity, something like if you totally made the opposite of Chrome. You can view ads for tokens, which you can tip to content creators, and you can expect much more from Chrome in the future. However, be aware of crypto scam ads and expect a little less speed when compared with other competitors.</p>
