<h1>File directories are simply letters and slashes jumbled together to locate files.</h1>

<p>You've probably seen file directories while searching up your important document or cat video. You've may have also questioned, what are they, and what do they do? What even is their purpose? In this blog post, I will be explaining how file directories work.</p>

<p>First and foremost, <strong>what are file directories?</strong> Its simple if you look at it. It can look something like "/home/Username/Desktop/PetVideos/MyCat.mp4/". Its pretty much random words being seperated by slashes in between. Easy definition, right?</p>

<p>What they <strong>DO</strong> is more complicated. Simply put, its a chain of file names and folders linking together to find a file at the end of the chain. Like the example above, its a chain of file locations finding the file "MyCat.mp4". the /home file is essentially the base of your computer, /Username is usually what account you are logged in to on your computer, /Desktop is, well, your desktop! Next, the /PetVideos is a folder. Thats where the video, MyCat.mp4 is located. And finally, your cat video, MyCat.mp4! Since there are no more files in the chain, MyCat.mp4 is the file to be located and opened.</p>
